Our research, [‘Exploring the Discovery Process of Fresh IPv6 Prefixes: An Analysis of Scanning Behavior in Darknet and Honeynet,’](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-56249-5_4) has been published at the Passive and Active Measurement Conference 2024. In this study, my fellow researchers and I analyzed the characteristics of scanning activities and the process of fresh prefix discovery in the IPv6 network.
