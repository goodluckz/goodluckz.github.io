I'm a Ph.D. student at the Graduate Institute for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan. I got my bachelor and master degree at the University of Tokyo.

As a researcher with a background in networking and communication, I have been working on several projects related to Age of Information, Named Data Network, transport protocol, data caching, and IPv6 network.
